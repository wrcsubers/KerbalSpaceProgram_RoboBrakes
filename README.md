#RoboBrakes

Automatic Braking System for Kerbal Space Program

Robo Brakes allows for better brake control by automating braking systems during Landing. You can chose which parts you want to act as brakes, including Landing Gear and Aero Surfaces. Parts are enabled/disabled by right clicking on them in the Editor or during Flight.

The Deactivation Speed setting allows your craft to automatically disengaged the brakes once the craft is below that threshold.

The Activation Delay setting allows you to set your craft down for a set time before automatically engaging all brakes.

Robo Brakes bypasses the built in braking system for enabled parts and allows you to set your B key to be a 'Press and Hold' type of action or a 'Toggle On and Off' type of action, or disable the B key all together.

Throttle Zeroing enables the main throttle to be automatically set to zero when Robo Brakes engages the brakes. This works in conjunction with the Activation Delay.
